Furniture Web App is a web-based furniture management and ordering application designed for furniture stores. Users can browse products, 
create orders, and track order statuses such as in production, ready for shipment, and delivered. The backend is developed with C# and ASP.NET 
Core MVC, while Entity Framework Core with MS SQL Server is used for data management. The frontend is built using Bootstrap and JavaScript, 
providing a responsive and interactive user experience. The project follows the MVC architecture and includes an admin panel for managing 
products and orders efficiently.
Features include user registration and authentication, order creation and submission, tracking order status, and an admin 
panel for managing products and orders.
